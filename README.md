# Student Assignment List & Course Updates

## Scenario
You've been given a poorly designed and built application page that students use to view their upcoming assignments and receive course updates. The campus has agreed to contract you for 2 hours of your time to make improvements. Your goals are to modernize the markup and styles, both in visual design and technical quality. How you approach this is entirely up to you, keeping in mind you may need to update and maintain this in the future. Keep in mind that some of the student's using this application page may have accessibility needs.

## Directions
1. Spend no more than two hours on this exercise. Time management is part of the assessment.
2. Fork this repository and submit your finished work as a pull request.
3. Make any changes to the site you see fit (including layout, design, and underlying code quality) while keeping the content. 
Assume the code behind the filters is functioning.
4. Set up the structure in a way that makes it easier to maintain moving forward. Bring in any additional resources and dependencies if you find that helpful. Explain major design or code decisions and things you'd do if you had more time.
